<p>Many people wonder, how exactly are the government controlling the weather? And I, Steven Hawking, will be explaining. </p>
</div>
<div style="color:gray">
<p>So, you may wonder. How is this possible? I'll tell you. Basically, one member of the government goes on a plane and they will crawl through a secret tunnel that only the pilots know about.</p>
</div>
<div style="color:gray">
<p> The tunnel goes into the wing, there is a ladder in the wing which is invisible from the outside. The member of the government then goes up the ladder and can safely stay on the wing. They are not able to fall because they have special grips on their shoes that ONLY the government have. </p>
</div>
<div style="color:gray">
<p>After they are on top of the wing, they climb up the side of the plane. They use their shoes to do this, they go on to the top of the plane where there is a seat. This seat is where the government control the weather from.</p>
</div>
<div style="color:gray">
<p>The memeber of the government sits in the seat and they connect a special tube to a cloud. Through this tube clouds are sucked in. If they want it to rain they plug in another tube which will sprinkle water in the cloud.</p>
</div>
<div style="color:gray">
<p>When they put water in the cloud, it is absorbed. Then later it will rain. THIS IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT MADE IT RAIN!!!!!! The government choose where they want it to flood and floods kill people. Therefore, the government are killers and need to be behind bars.</p>
</div>
<div style="color:gray">
<p>This is how the weather reporters know the weather, they are reported to by the government everyday, usually between 1-3am in the morning.</p>
</div>
<div style="color:gray">
<p>The government also make it sunny, they do it by sucking all of the rain out of the clouds with a tube.</p>
